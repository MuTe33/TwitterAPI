# TwitterAPI

A Twitter API which stores tweets based on a hashtag list and validates them using the "Textblob" library based on polarity and subjectivity.

"Textblob" offers simple text recognition in the sense of NLP ("natural language processing"). The features of polarity and subjectivity have been used. 
The polarity was measured on a scale from -1 to +1. -1 means the tweet is negative, +1 means it is positive and 0 means neutral. 
The scale of subjectivity goes from 0 to +1. Here 0 means very objective and 1 means very subjective.

Feel free to use as much as you want to.
